 AI House Price Prediction System

This is a Machine Learning-based web application that predicts house prices using property details such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, construction year, and city. The model is trained using a Gradient Boosting Regressor and deployed with a Gradio-based web interface for real-time predictions.

 Features
- Predicts house prices in real time
- Uses city-based target encoding for better location accuracy
- Clean ML pipeline with data preprocessing and model persistence
- Web-based user interface using Gradio
- Easy to run locally or deploy to the cloud
